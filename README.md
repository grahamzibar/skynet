skynet (BlackBerry 10 port)
======

WebWorks App to control an AR Drone ported from a Chrome App by tazsingh and jdjkelly.  Due to their awesome coding abilities, they have a nice separation of views, controllers, and models.  To port this to BlackBerry 10, we're simply going to modify the views for a BlackBerry 10 look & feel (or, at the very least, a mobile layout optimized for the device) and modify how the app networks with the Quadricopter.
